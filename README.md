# MinigameJudge

Osu! mania judgement counter for use with [gosumemory](https://github.com/l3lackShark/gosumemory), with the look of Etterna. Updates in real time.

</div>



Includes:

- Accuracy
- Unstable rate
- All judgements
- Early/late (how far you were from 320)
- Total notes (includes misses)
- Ratio (`320 hits / 300 hits`)

To turn on debug mode go to index.js and change the line `const debug = false;` to `const debug = true;`. It will enable a small number which shows you the render time of each websocket message.

Ingame:
